        <p>Oral cancer is the second most predominantly occurring carcinoma and cause of cancer deaths in India
due to excessive chewing of smokeless tobacco. An effective therapy is urgently needed to tackle the
health emergency. siRNA driven intervention is most suitable because it has a distinct advantage over
small molecule and monoclonal antibodies, as siRNA executes its function by complete Watson-Crick
base pairing with mRNA. However, discovering siRNA for exclusive targeting is difficult due to high
flexibility of the RNA molecule accrued from large conformational degrees of freedom. Sequence based
discovery methods are not very effective as they are unable to preclude off site targeting. Machine
learning based methods have limited use due to lack of data. Here we propose to discover new siRNA,
and siRNA inhibitory small molecules with high affinity. The methods and analysis to be developed will
be generic, but our applications will focus on Oral cancer. We aim to use structure and dynamics
analysis to screen the siRNA molecules. For large scale application, we will develop a new coarsegrained
forcefield for RNA utilizing our previous knowledge of developing the same for proteins.
Experience shows that custom coarse-grained forcefields are essential for any discovery effort despite
availability of the same in public domain. The coarse-grained approach will facilitate genome-wide
screening by analyses of structural dynamics fingerprint. Subsequent to global screening, highresolution
all-atom analysis will be performed on a small subset for final scoring and ranking. Thus, a
two-stage approach will help us economically screen small RNA molecules for RNA interference in a
genome-wide scale. We will be using existing data set of known siRNA for the work and gather more
data for the same for oral cancer from literature and existing data bases. The small molecule screening
for siRNA inhibition will be done using a combinatorial structure generation program developed in our
lab. For this all high-scoring compounds identified will be taken as seeds and atoms in such compounds
which form hydrogen bonds will be used to form roots of trees, that are combinatorially altered to
create new substructures, which can be mixed and matched to generate new molecules for screening.
These can then be docked at the same site as the parent molecule to identify higher affinity compounds.
This kind of approach is apt for finding a suitable small molecule for a flexible receptor like the siRNA.
The work will propel high throughput structure-based screening of small RNA molecule powered by a
coarse-grained forcefield specifically developed for that purpose. It will open up new avenues of siRNA
discovery and RNA-based drug discovery that leverage dynamics information and combinatorial small
molecule structure generation. These are promising new areas of drug discovery that need intensive
            exploration for early benefits to our country.</p>
